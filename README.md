- Recipes and version control allows one to iterate and improve on the baseline recipe. Many of the recipes here are initially sourced from varying places on the Internet. Git allows you to change the initial recipe and improve them according to your preferences. They quickly evolve and become something better and more your own.

- This repository seeks to find and use simple baseline recipes that can be adapted, and iterated upon.
