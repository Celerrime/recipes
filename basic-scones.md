British Scones :: American Biscuits
(abbreviated from kingarthurflour.com/recipes/scones-recipe)

Serves 12

## Ingredients
--------------
- 326g all purpose flour
- 67g sugar
- 3/4 tsp salt
- 1 tbsp baking powder
- 113g cold butter
- 2 large eggs
- 2 tsp vanilla extract (or choice flavoring)
- 113-152g half-and-half or whole milk (less during humid seasons, more in dry)
- *optional fruit, nuts, chocolate chips, etc. for step 3

## Method
---------
1. Mix dry ingredients (flour, sugar, salt, and baking powder)
2. Work in butter until crumbly; OK for large chunks
3. *Stir in optional add-ins
4. Mix wet ingredients in separate bowl (eggs, vanilla, half-and-half/milk)
5. Add mixed wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and stir until moistened and held together
6. Line baking sheet with parchment. Spread some flour onto the parchment.
7. Scrape dough onto floured parchment surface and divide in half. Round each half into a 5-6 inches diameter. 3/4in think.
8. *Brush each circle with milk. Sprinkle coarse white sparkling sugar, or cinnamon sugar
9. Divide each circle in 6 wedges
10. Carefully pull wedges away from center
11. Place pan of scones in freezer for 30m. This relaxes gluten in the flour, making scones more tender, allowing them to rise higher. Chilled fat makes for flakier scones as well.
12. Preheat oven to 425 F while scones are chilling.
13. Bake for 20-25m until golden brown. Edge shouldn't look wet or unbaked.
14. Remove scones from oven and let cool. Serve warm with butter, or jam.

## Notes
--------
Storage - when scones are completely cool, wrap them in plastic and store at room temperature for up to several days. Reheat in 350F for 10m.

* Savory scones - reduce sugar to 2 tbsp and omit vanilla. Add 1-2 cups of savory add-ins (i.e., cheese, fresh/dried herbs, crumbled bacon, etc.) after you've worked in the butter, and before adding the liquid.

* Drop scones (rather than wedge-shaped) - increase half-and-half/milk to 3/4 cup. Use a large ice cream scoop or spoon to dollop the scone in 1/3 cupfuls. Bake at 375F for 30m
